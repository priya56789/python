# Write a function named find_length(obj) that uses a loop to calculate the
# length of the given object without using the built-in len() function. The
# function should return the calculated length if the object is iterable. If a
# non-iterable object such as an integer is passed, the function should raise and
# handle a TypeError, and print an appropriate error message explaining what
# happens when an integer is sent as input.



def find_length(obj):
    try:
        count=0
        for i in obj:
            count+=1
        return count
    except TypeError as e:
        print("Object is not iterable")
print(find_length("priyanka"))
print(find_length([10,20,30,40,50]))
print(find_length(10))
