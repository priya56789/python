# 3. Given a list:
# nums = [12, 15, 7, 18, 20, 21, 25]
# Use filter() and lambda to keep numbers that are divisible by 3 OR divisible by
# 5 but NOT divisible by both.
# Explain how the logical condition works


nums=[12,15,7,18,20,21,25]
result=list(filter(lambda x:x%3==0 or x%5==0 and not x%3==0 and x%5==0,nums))
print(result)
